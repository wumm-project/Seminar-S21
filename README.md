# Leipzig Seminar - Summer Term 2021

* lecture: th/do 11:15-12:45 
* Seminar: tu/di 9:15-10:45 

## Conception

The seminar is part of the advanced master module "Modelling of Sustainable
Systems and Semantic Web", which also includes a lecture and an online lab
with the TRIZ trainer of Nikolay Shpakovsky.

In this semester's seminar, we want to deal with forms of cooperative action
as well as the institutionalisation of conceptual, notational and experiential
forms in such structures in particular. In the context of our understanding of
technology, which includes the three components 
* socially available processual knowledge,
* institutionalised procedures
* and private processual skills

It concentrates on a better understanding of the form-building processes of
institutionalised procedures. The contradiction-oriented analytical methods of
TRIZ can be applied to these questions, whereby the concepts that have been
developed in the "world of technical systems" have already been extended to
management processes and management structures within the field of "Business
TRIZ". However, modern management approaches yet are insufficiently taken up
here. In the seminar, such connections will be examined more closely, in
particular

* Approaches of the Methodological School of Management in the traditions of
  the MMC around G.P. Shchedrovitsky
* The Co-operative Action approach
* Other management approaches that focus on social interactions.

## A General Theory of Strong Thinking

Thinking in terms of contradictions and modelling (initially) contradictory
situations is a fundamental engineering and management competence, its
teaching in the context of a "General Theory of Strong Thinking" (OTSM-TRIZ)
and its further development as the "Innovative Design Method" (IDM) is at the
centre of our teaching programme.

## Challenges to such a theoretical approach

Ibid, slide 36
> In order to be universal, the rules of problem solving methods should be as
> general as possible. But the more general the rules of problem solving are,
> the more general and the less practical the solution will be. And vice
> versa: when the rules (and methods) are specific and precise, they are
> helpful for solving a specific problem which is of practical use.  However,
> the more specific they are the less universal they are as well.

Ibid, slide 40

> Any problem can be stated as a contradiction between our _subjective
> desires_ for something appearing in a _specific context_ on the one hand,
> and _objective laws_ that cause this specific situation, one the other hand.

Ibid, slide 42
> Any element should be seen as a process and vice versa. This process, which
> is linked with a human being as soon as we are in a problem solving context,
> evolves in accordance with objective laws and takes into account specific
> objective and subjective factors.

## Data protection

We follow an Open Culture approach not only theoretically but also practically
and make course materials publicly available.  This also applies to the course
materials you have to produce (presentations, seminar papers) as well as to
(annotated) chat sessions of the seminar discussions, in which your names are
also mentioned.  We assume your consent to this procedure if you do not
explicitly object.  The discussions themselves are __not__ recorded.
