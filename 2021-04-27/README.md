# Seminar on 27 April 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Business Modelling Basics, ISO 9000 and CMMI
* __Presenter:__ Hans-Gert Gr√§be

## Abstract

First, continuing the explanations in last seminar, dimensions of a systemic
approach will be explored in more detail.

Then the conceptual field of _organisation, management, leadership_ according
to G.P. Shchedrovitsky (see [MSM: p. 26 ff.]) will be briefly introduced.

Finally, on this basis, tasks and forms of movement of a systematic management
within organisations will be considered. A central result is that management
means to _control the processes_ taking place in the (living) organisation
with the _goal_ to implement the _purposes_ of the organisation in an
efficient way.

To this end, we first look at the control loop of the ISO 9000 process model.
ISO 9000 is a standard for the _evaluation_ of process quality, the process
model specified there is thus a reference for good process organisation within
a company.

Process models in their development dimension are then discussed using the
example of CMM(I) as a _maturity model for organisational development_ in the
software sector.

## From the Chat

(sorry, not all parts of the discussion were saved)

- Ralf Laue : How do we translate the difference between "goal" and
  "objective" into German? Is there a difference?
  - Lukas Heink : I just did some googling and it seems to be summarised as
    follows: "Goals are general guidelines that explain what you want to
    achieve in your community.  Objectives define strategies or implementation
    steps to achieve the identified goals."
  - It is in general hard to translate notions (here: _Zweck_ and _Ziel_) to
    an other language, since there are no precise translations due to the
    different semantic breakdown of the conceptual systems in the respective
    language.  There are more English words in use in that area: aim (Ziel),
    purpose (Zweck, Verwendungszweck, Einsatzzweck), objective (Adresse,
    Gegenstand, Ziel, Zweck), goal (Ziel, Tor, Gegentor) - Translations
    proposed by <https://www.deepl.com/translator>
  - This is also one of the major problems of translating TRIZ terminology
    from Russian into English and German.  It is a matter of translating an
    existing set of terms in use in one language into the target language in a
    uniform way. To this end, it makes sense to develop a glossary and
    initially a thesaurus in which the designators of the terms in different
    languages are compared.  <https://www.altshuller.ru/thesaur/thesaur.asp>

- Heuten : Are there institutions that help companies to get ISO 9000
  certification? How long does it take and how much does it cost?
  - <https://qm-guru.de/faq/iso-9000-zertifizierung/>

- Daniel Werner : On slide 8, management and leadership were mentioned. The
  handout goes on to say "They may temporarily conceal their own goals, but
  they may use the performance of their official tasks to achieve their own
  goals". What exactly is meant by this?
- Windhorst, Marie : I also have a question about leadership.


  - Leadership plays a secondary role in [MSM], the focus is on management in
    the understanding explained in the handout (i.e. as a control function in
    a "living" organisation, because management in [MSM] is bound to
    self-propulsion). Leadership is a specific mode of operation in an
    organisation through which the dominance of the organisation's goals is
    established against the goals of the elements involved (insofar as these
    are in conflict with each other).  The leader himself is most affected by
    the abandonment of own goals. However, here too a distinction must be made
    between the person and the role - the statements refer more to the role of
    the leader than to the person. In general, this difference between the
    goals of the organisation and the goals of the elements of the
    organisation marks a contradictory field of tension. Finally, remember the
    thesis in [MSM] that organisations do not have goals, but that these are
    brought in by people (through leadership).

- Felix Walter : So a system becomes efficient when its socio-technical goal
  orientation becomes heterogeneous: Is that contrary to an idea of innovation
  that can protect the system from external processes of change and adapt it
  if necessary? And didn't we say before that it is precisely an "organiser"
  that is needed to pursue "active" goal setting?

  - In [MSM], a clear distinction is made between the goals that stand at the
    beginning of the creation of an organisation and the (often changed) goals
    that emerge in the further development of the "living" organisation.  In
    this sense, building up the organisation transforms into further
    development of the organisation. The conceptual ideas about further
    development are usually anchored in strategic management, but even here
    they are structured differently than in the bootstrap of the organisation,
    since even in the strategic decisions the (real existing) laws of
    self-propulsion of the respective organisation play a decisive role, which
    in the bootstrap, due to lack of the real existence of the organisation as
    a "living system", can only be addressed in its potentiality. With the
    "living" organisation, the control loop between justified expectations
    and experienced results also comes into play, which clearly changes the
    situation.

  - On the subject of avoiding change processes, see the discussions on
    "resilience" in the winter semester a year ago.
